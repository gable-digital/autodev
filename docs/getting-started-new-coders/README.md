# Getting Started with AutoDev | New Coders

Welcome to AutoDev! This guide will help you get set up and start using AutoDev to build your first project.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   **VS Code:** A free, powerful code editor.
    -   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Development Tools:** Essential software for coding (Homebrew, Node.js, Git, etc.).
    -   Follow our [Installing Essential Development Tools](installing-dev-essentials.md) guide to set these up with AutoDev's help (after getting setup here)
    -   AutoDev will guide you through installing everything you need
-   **AutoDev Projects Folder:** A dedicated folder for all your AutoDev projects.
    -   On macOS: Create a folder named "AutoDev" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/AutoDev`
    -   On Windows: Create a folder named "AutoDev" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\AutoDev`
    -   Inside this AutoDev folder, create separate folders for each project
        -   Example: `Documents/AutoDev/workout-app` for a workout tracking app
        -   Example: `Documents/AutoDev/portfolio-website` for your portfolio
-   **AutoDev Extension in VS Code:** The AutoDev extension installed in VS Code.

## Step-by-Step Setup

Follow these steps to get AutoDev up and running:

1. **Open VS Code:** Launch the VS Code application. If VS Code shows "Running extensions might...", click "Allow".

2. **Open Your AutoDev Folder:** In VS Code, open the AutoDev folder you created in Documents.

3. **Navigate to Extensions:** Click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code.

4. **Search for 'AutoDev':** In the Extensions search bar, type "AutoDev".

5. **Install the Extension:** Click the "Install" button next to the AutoDev extension.

6. **Open AutoDev:** Once installed, you can open AutoDev in a few ways:
    - Click the AutoDev icon in the Activity Bar.
    - Use the command palette (`CMD/CTRL + Shift + P`) and type "AutoDev: Open In New Tab" to open AutoDev as a tab in your editor. This is recommended for a better view.
    - **Troubleshooting:** If you don't see the AutoDev icon, try restarting VS Code.
    - **What You'll See:** You should see the AutoDev chat window appear in your VS Code editor.

    -   Input your OpenRouter API key.
    -   Select your preferred API model.
        -   **Recommended Models for Coding:**
            -   `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`: Most used for coding tasks.
            -   `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`: A free option for coding.
            -   `deepseek/deepseek-chat`: SUPER CHEAP, almost as good as 3.5 sonnet

## Your First Interaction with AutoDev

Now you're ready to start building with AutoDev. Let's create your first project folder and build something! Copy and paste the following prompt into the AutoDev chat window:

```
Hey AutoDev! Could you help me create a new project folder called "hello-world" in my AutoDev directory and make a simple webpage that says "Hello World" in big blue text?
```

**What You'll See:** AutoDev will help you create the project folder and set up your first webpage.

## Tips for Working with AutoDev

-   **Ask Questions:** If you're unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask AutoDev!
-   **Use Screenshots:** AutoDev can understand images, so feel free to use screenshots to show him what you're working on.

## FAQs

-   **What is the Terminal?** The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It allows you to run commands to perform various tasks, such as installing packages, running scripts, and managing files. AutoDev uses the terminal to execute commands and interact with your development environment.
-   **How Does the Codebase Work?** (This section will be expanded based on common questions from new coders)
