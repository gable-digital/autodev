   - [ ] Study API request combination
   - [ ] Examine rate limiting systems
   - [ ] Document existing queue patterns

### Active Development
1. Code Coverage Setup
   - [ ] Configure Jest coverage tracking
   - [ ] Set up 90% threshold requirement
   - [ ] Create coverage exclusion patterns
   - [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI

2. Instruction Queue Implementation
   - [ ] Create message queue infrastructure
   - [ ] Implement queue state management
   - [ ] Add UI support for queued instructions
   - [ ] Implement queue priority handling
   - [ ] Add queue status indicators

   - Add state management support
   - Write initial test suite

2. UI Integration (Phase 2)
   - Add queue status display
   - Enable instruction input during processing
   - Implement queue management controls
   - Update UI components

3. Testing & Refinement (Phase 3)
   - Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling improvements
   - Edge case testing

## Upcoming Work

### Short Term
1. Queue System Implementation
   - Design and implement message queue architecture
   - Add queue state management and synchronization
   - Create queue operation handlers
   - Implement priority-based processing

2. UI Enhancements
   - Add queue status visualization
   - Implement instruction input during processing
   - Add queue management controls
   - Create progress indicators

### Long Term
1. Performance Optimizations
   - Optimize state synchronization
   - Improve initialization speed
   - Reduce memory footprint
   - Monitor queue memory usage

2. User Experience Enhancements
   - Add loading state indicators
   - Improve error messaging

   - Refine queue status display

## Known Issues
1. Message Processing
   - UI becomes unresponsive during API calls
   - Blocking operations prevent new instruction input
   - Single-threaded message processing bottleneck
   - State synchronization during queue operations

2. Queue Management
   - Need to handle message priority effectively
   - Queue state persistence requirements
   - Error recovery for queued operations
   - Memory management for long queues
