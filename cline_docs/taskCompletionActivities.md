# Task Completion Requirements

## Testing Requirements

Before ANY task can be considered complete, you MUST verify:

1. Code Compilation
   - All code MUST compile successfully
   - No build errors or warnings
   - Use appropriate build commands for the project type
   - Address any compiler warnings or errors immediately

2. Functionality Testing
   - All new/modified functionality works correctly as expected
   - Test all edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify integration with existing features
   - Test user interactions and workflows
   - Use appropriate testing tools:
     - Unit tests for business logic
     - Integration tests for system components
     - UI testing for user interfaces
     - Manual testing when necessary
   - Queue-specific testing:
     - Message queue operations work correctly
     - Queue state updates properly
     - Queue events trigger appropriate actions
     - Error handling for queued messages
     - Queue status display updates correctly
     - Multiple queued messages handled properly
     - Queue priority handling works as expected

3. Code Coverage Requirements
   - Minimum 90% code coverage required
   - Coverage must include:
     - All code branches
     - Error handling paths
     - Edge cases
     - Business logic variations
   - Use appropriate testing frameworks and coverage tools
   - Document any areas that cannot be tested automatically

## Documentation Requirements

1. Project Documentation
   - All documentation MUST be placed in the /docs folder
   - Update existing documentation to reflect changes
   - Create new documentation for new features
   - Documentation must include:
     - Setup instructions
     - Configuration guides
     - Usage examples
     - API documentation
     - Architecture decisions (ADRs)

2. Code Documentation
   - Clear and concise comments
   - XML documentation for public APIs
   - Update relevant README files
   - Document any known limitations or constraints

3. Component Requirements
   - Type Safety
     - All component props must have explicit interfaces
     - Function props must have defined signatures
     - No use of 'any' type
     - Props documentation with JSDoc comments

   - React Best Practices
     - Hooks must be at component top level
     - useCallback for all event handlers
     - Proper dependency arrays in hooks
     - No conditional hook calls
     - Performance optimizations documented

   - State Management
     - Clear ownership of state
     - Documented state update patterns
     - Proper prop drilling or context usage
     - State synchronization patterns
     - Queue state management:
       - Queue state properly tracked
       - State updates trigger UI updates
       - Queue status properly displayed
       - Queue operations reflected in state

   - Error Handling
     - Component error boundaries defined
     - Error states handled gracefully
     - User feedback for error conditions
     - Error recovery patterns documented

3. Memory Bank Updates
   - Update activeContext.md with current status
   - Document any new technical decisions
   - Record known issues and limitations
   - Update progress tracking

Remember: These requirements are NOT optional. ALL must be met before marking a task as complete.
