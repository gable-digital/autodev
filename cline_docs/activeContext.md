# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing instruction queuing system to allow users to enter follow-up instructions while the extension is processing API calls, editing files, or thinking.

### Required Pre-Implementation File Review
1. Message Processing Files:
   - `src/core/sliding-window/index.ts`: Check for existing queue-like implementations
   - `src/core/assistant-message/index.ts`: Understand message processing flow
   - `src/core/assistant-message/parse-assistant-message.ts`: Review message parsing
   - `src/services/llm-access-control/`: Review rate limiting/queuing
   - `src/shared/combineApiRequests.ts`: Check request combination logic
   - `src/shared/combineCommandSequences.ts`: Review command sequencing

2. Test Implementation Files:
   - `src/test/extension.test.ts`: Review test patterns
   - `src/api/retry.test.ts`: Study retry mechanism tests
   - `src/utils/cost.test.ts`: Examine test structure
   - `src/shared/array.test.ts`: Review array utility tests

### Investigation Findings

1. Recent Codebase Changes:
   - Extension identifiers updated from 'claude-dev' to 'gds-autodev'
   - Firebase authentication temporarily disabled during transition
   - Enhanced initialization sequence with state verification
   - Improved error handling and logging infrastructure

2. Existing Queue-Like Implementations:
   - Sliding window implementation in `src/core/sliding-window/index.ts`
   - Command sequence combination in `src/shared/combineCommandSequences.ts`
   - API request combination in `src/shared/combineApiRequests.ts`
   - Rate limiting in `src/services/llm-access-control/`

3. Current Implementation Analysis:
   - Messages flow through ExtensionStateContext (webview) and ClineProvider (extension)
   - Webview UI becomes unresponsive during:
     - API calls (streaming responses)
     - File operations
     - State processing
     - Message handling
   - Root cause: Single message processing thread blocks UI interaction

2. Key Files Involved:
   - `webview-ui/src/context/ExtensionStateContext.tsx`: Manages webview state and message handling
   - `src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts`: Handles extension-side message processing
   - `src/shared/WebviewMessage.ts`: Defines message types from webview to extension
   - `src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts`: Defines message types from extension to webview
   - `src/extension.ts`: Main extension activation and command registration

3. Current Message Flow:
   ```
   User Input -> Webview UI 
   -> ExtensionStateContext (blocks) 
   -> ClineProvider 
   -> API/File Operations (blocks) 
   -> Response -> Webview
   ```

### Initialization Flow Analysis

1. Current Sequence:
   ```
   resolveWebviewView
   ↓
   Load HTML content with error handling
   ↓
   Set up message listener with error handling
   ↓
   Initialize webview state
   ↓
   Post initial state with verification
   ↓
   Wait for state processing (1500ms)
   ↓
   Verify state received
   ↓
   Mark as initialized
   ↓
   Handle visibility if needed
   ```

2. Error Handling:
   - Granular error boundaries for each initialization step
   - Comprehensive logging through outputChannel
   - Non-critical errors allowed to continue
   - Critical errors halt initialization

### Code Coverage Requirements

1. Test Coverage Goals:
   - 90% coverage requirement for new queue functionality
   - Coverage tracking setup in package.json
   - Separate coverage reporting for new code
   - Integration with existing test infrastructure

2. Coverage Areas:
   - Queue operations and state management
   - Message priority handling
   - Error scenarios and recovery
   - Edge cases and race conditions
   - UI interaction scenarios

3. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Jest configuration for coverage reporting
   - Coverage exclusion patterns for existing code
   - Custom coverage reporter setup
   - CI/CD integration points

### Memory Bank Update Points

1. Phase 1 - Core Implementation:
   - After analyzing existing queue-like code
   - After creating initial queue infrastructure
   - After implementing basic operations
   - After writing core tests

2. Phase 2 - UI Integration:
   - After implementing queue status display
   - After adding instruction input handling
   - After implementing queue controls
   - After UI component tests

3. Phase 3 - Testing & Refinement:
   - After reaching coverage goals
   - After performance optimization
   - After edge case handling
   - Before final release

### Implementation Plan

1. Message Queue System
   - Create new message queue in ExtensionStateContext
   - Add queue management for incoming user instructions
   - Implement priority handling for different message types
   - Add state tracking for queued messages

2. State Management Updates
   - Add queue state to ExtensionState interface
   - Implement queue status indicators in UI
   - Add queue management methods to ClineProvider
   - Create new message types for queue operations

3. UI Enhancements
   - Add visual feedback for queued instructions
   - Implement queue status display
   - Add ability to cancel/modify queued instructions
   - Show progress indicators for queued items

4. Required Files to Create/Modify:
   ```
   src/shared/MessageQueue.ts (new)
   src/shared/QueueTypes.ts (new)
   src/core/queue/QueueManager.ts (new)
   Modified files:
   - webview-ui/src/context/ExtensionStateContext.tsx
   - src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts
   - src/shared/WebviewMessage.ts
   - src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts
   ```

### Testing Plan

1. Coverage Setup:
   - Configure Jest for coverage tracking

   - UI responsiveness during operations
   - Queue state synchronization
   - Error handling with queued messages

   - Long-running operations
   - Queue management edge cases
   - UI interaction during processing

### Implementation Phases

1. Phase 1: Core Queue Implementation
   - Create message queue infrastructure

### Next Steps

1. Initial Investigation:
   - Review all identified files
   - Document existing queue-like implementations
   - Analyze test coverage setup
   - Update memory bank with findings

2. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Create MessageQueue.ts and QueueTypes.ts
   - Implement core queue functionality

   - State synchronization requirements
   - Message ordering dependencies
   - Error handling complexity

3. Performance Considerations:
   - Queue memory management
   - Message processing overhead
   - UI responsiveness requirements
