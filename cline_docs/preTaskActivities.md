# Pre-Task Activities

## CRITICAL: Code Review Requirements

Before starting ANY task, you MUST:

1. Read ALL memory bank files.
2. Read ALL existing code files that are relevant to the task
   - This is a MANDATORY requirement
   - It CANNOT be skipped under any circumstances
   - Use tools like:
     - `list_files` to explore the project structure
     - `read_file` to examine file contents
     - `search_files` to find related code
     - `list_code_definition_names` to understand code organization

3. Analyze the code to understand:
   - Existing patterns and conventions
   - Related functionality
   - Dependencies and relationships
   - Potential impact areas
   - Queue-related considerations:
     - Message flow and processing
     - State management patterns
     - Error handling approaches
     - UI update mechanisms
     - Event handling patterns
4. Follow instructions in memory bank files as you work to complete the task.

5. Document findings in activeContext.md before proceeding with any changes

## CRITICAL: Documentation Review Requirements

Before starting ANY task, you MUST:

1. Read ALL existing documentation in the /docs folder
   - This is a MANDATORY requirement
   - Documentation may contain critical information about:
     - Project architecture
     - Design decisions
     - Configuration requirements
     - Development workflows
     - Known limitations

2. Review Memory Bank files:
   - activeContext.md for current status
   - systemPatterns.md for architecture patterns
   - techContext.md for technical requirements
   - productContext.md for project goals
   - progress.md for development status

3. Analyze documentation to understand:
   - Project standards and conventions
   - Required workflows and processes
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Configuration requirements
   - Queue system requirements:
     - Message queue architecture
     - State synchronization patterns
     - Error recovery procedures
     - UI feedback mechanisms
     - Testing requirements

Remember: Never start writing code without first thoroughly reviewing and understanding both the existing codebase and documentation that relates to your task.
